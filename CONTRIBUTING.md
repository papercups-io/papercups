# Creating a PR

Just create a new pull request if you want to make an update. We would prefer that you open an issue describing the update first if possible!

For now, please request Alex (@reichert621) to review.

If you want to speak to us before doing lots of work, just email founders@papercups.io - we're very responsive and friendly!
