# Papercups

Papercups is an open source live customer chat web app written in Elixir. We offer a hosted version at [app.papercups.io](https://app.papercups.io/).

You can check out how our chat widget looks and play around with customizing it on our [demo page](https://app.papercups.io/demo/). The chat widget component is also open sourced at [github.com/papercups-io/chat-widget](https://github.com/papercups-io/chat-widget).

## Philosophy

We wanted to make a self-hosted version of tools like Intercom and Drift for companies that have privacy and security concerns about having customer data going to third party services. We’re starting with chat right now but we want to expand into all forms of customer communication like email campaigns and push notifications.

Stay tuned! We'll be posting a more detailed roadmap soon 🤓
