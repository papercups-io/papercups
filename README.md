The code behind papercups.io

# One click heroku deployment
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/papercups-io/papercups)


## Getting started

To start your server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start the server with `mix phx.server`

This will automatically start up the React frontend in watch mode on `localhost:3000`, with the API running on `localhost:4000`.

### To start client side 

see: [README](assets/README.md)

## Running tests

Create postgres test database named: `chat_api_test`

```
mix test
```

## Deploying

We currently use Heroku for deployments:

```
git push heroku master
```

## Running compiler on file change

_Note_: Make sure you are running this inside of ChatApi otherwise it'll trigger on UI changes

```
./scripts/compile_watch.sh
```
